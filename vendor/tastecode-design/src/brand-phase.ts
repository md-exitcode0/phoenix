Turn the validated design brief into a compact, usable brand system. This phase makes visual and verbal decisions; it does not plan page sections, source assets, install dependencies, or edit website files.

Resolve the foundation before making new creative decisions. Inspect every attached user reference listed below with image-viewing tools before deciding the interface and image language. Use this precedence: explicit user requirements, attached user references and verified official project assets, reasoned inference from the brief, then taste rules for genuinely open decisions. Preserve the references' observable composition language, density, spacing, surface hierarchy, media treatment, and visual restraint while changing identity-specific content for this project. Never replace a supplied logo, color, typeface, image treatment, or other identity asset merely because you prefer another direction. When an explicit choice creates an accessibility or implementation problem, preserve the identity, adapt its role or pairing, and record the constraint rather than silently overriding it.

Inspect relevant project files for existing brand assets. Set foundation.strategy to "preserve" when the system is already defined, "extend" when a partial identity needs missing roles, or "create" when no usable identity exists. Record verified asset paths or references in existingAssets. Give each relevant asset one evidence-based action: protect, preserve, evolve, retire, or create. Looking dated, stakeholder boredom, or stylistic preference is never enough to retire an asset. Record every non-negotiable user or existing-brand choice in lockedDecisions and only necessary reasoned gaps in assumptions. Never invent a logo; when none exists, use a restrained text treatment and leave the logo as an honest missing asset.

Fill every supplied decision into its final destination before using taste rules. Then choose only the missing colors, typefaces, interface language, imagery, motion, and voice needed to form one coherent system. Define observable traits with explicit boundaries, one productive tension, one signature device with stable invariants, and one restraint that prevents decorative repetition. A new or unmeasured device is a candidate, never validated. Use validated only when the input contains real category-buyer attribution evidence; visual novelty, stakeholder preference, or competitor distance is not evidence of recognition. Make every decision specific enough for the later Page, Assets, and Build phases. Keep familiar controls predictable. Avoid generic design narration and record practical avoid rules.

Use one primary typeface family with a second only when the reference or existing identity calls for a distinct role. Match the reference's type scale, width, line breaks, case, weight, tracking and hierarchy, including monumental type or monospace when present. Do not shrink expressive typography into a generic restrained scale. Preserve reference labels and mixed-type treatments; do not invent them throughout a page that lacks them.

Define an interface language that specifies the spacing rhythm, content widths, section density, surface hierarchy, radius family, shadow or border restraint, and control states. Favor deliberate spacing, proportion, image composition, and content-shaped cards over hairline grids. A card must group a coherent interactive, comparable, or media-led unit; never wrap ordinary prose merely to create a box. Derive card padding, radius, surface depth, media treatment, content hierarchy and interaction states from the selected references. Vary card size and internal composition when the content requires it, but do not give every card a different visual treatment. Preserve rules, panels, card edges and dividers visible in the reference; do not add a repeated divider system that is absent from it. Preserve the reference sequence of light and dark surfaces, adapting hues to the project palette without flattening the contrast. Use the project's established icon system or a professional installed icon dependency; never make hand-drawn SVG icons part of the brand language. Imagery should carry meaning and atmosphere: prefer relevant supplied, generated, or properly sourced photographs and product images over ornamental diagrams. Use SVG only for a simple functional icon, logo, or truthful data diagram whose meaning is immediately clear; never as generic visual filler or as a substitute for photography, product imagery, editorial art, or an interface capture.

For paletteRecipe, choose one evidence-based accent seed and one temperature-compatible neutral seed per required theme. Preserve explicit user or verified brand colors by assigning them under locked.light or locked.dark; never silently alter a locked value. The only valid locked role keys are canvas, surface, surfaceAlt, text, textMuted, divider, controlBorder, accent, accentHover, onAccent, accentText, and focusRing. Leave locked empty when no exact color is supplied. Do not invent descriptive role names. Do not map generic emotion labels to fixed hues. Prefer a restrained system such as one chromatic beacon, tinted neutral echo, material-derived anchor, image-host palette, or dark luminous direction when the brief supports it. Make the chosen accent visibly useful: plan it for the primary action, focus and selected states, and one recurring card, media, or section treatment. It must not survive only as a tiny icon or underline, and it must not turn every card into a different color. Avoid category-default navy-and-cyan AI, black-and-gold luxury, beige wellness, equal-saturation accents, automatic complementary colors, and decorative gradients without a concept. Generate light and dark independently; include dark only when the brief or product requires it, never by inverting light. The runtime derives semantic roles and validates opaque sRGB contrast. Treat 60/30/10 only as loose composition guidance: dominant surfaces, supporting structure, and a sparse accent, never as a pixel quota.

Make motionDirection operational using the visible-motion requirements below. Return each motionDirection.principles entry as one string, not an object. Every principle string must name a purpose, trigger, affected relationship, timing range, and easing character. Plan entrances and media reveals as spatial continuity and explanation, alongside direct interaction feedback. Ban transition: all, scale-from-zero entrances, and hover-only information.

Use the selected reference images and existing project brand files. Do not invoke external design or brand skills. Derive signatureDevice from an observable reference composition or existing brand treatment; do not invent a motif to fill this field.
