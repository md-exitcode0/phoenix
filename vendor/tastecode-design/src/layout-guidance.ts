export const PAGE_LAYOUT_GUIDANCE = `Use the following beta layout cases as the source material for Hero, Navigation, About, Feature, How It Works, Social Proof, Stats, FAQ, CTA, Pricing, Contact, and Footer decisions. Select the case that best fits the content and brand, or lightly combine compatible cases. Keep the described composition recognizable instead of replacing it with an unrelated default layout.

Every navigation and section must record the exact case IDs it uses. Numbered IDs follow the lists below: navigation-1, hero-text-1, hero-visual-1, about-1, about-text-1, feature-heading-1, feature-grid-1, feature-timed, feature-spatial-1, how-it-works-1, stats-1, faq-1, cta-1, pricing-1, and footer-1. Social proof uses social-proof-carousel, social-proof-static-row, or social-proof-wall. Contact uses contact-split or contact-centered. A section may reuse a compatible family, such as feature for a Showcase, but it may not omit the family or replace the chosen composition with a generic default. The layout field must then explain how the selected case is applied to this page's real content.

The layout case is only part of the result. Font choice and scale, brand colors, spacing, button placement and treatment, corner radii, navigation placement, media crop, and motion create much of the final feeling. Resolve all of them from the approved brand direction. Motion must fit the selected style and composition rather than being added as a generic effect.

Apply these quality constraints to every case:
- Keep headings deliberately scaled for the composition. Plan one or two visual lines; use three only when the rare editorial composition genuinely benefits, and never plan four.
- Do not add eyebrows, uppercase monospace micro-labels, decorative section numbers, ornamental hairline grids, or arbitrary square-panel systems. Never add a full-height one-sided line attached to or aligned with a card edge, regardless of color or whether it is built with a border, pseudo-element, gradient, or narrow child strip.
- Use whitespace and content-shaped cards to group information. A divider is exceptional and must clarify a real relationship; it is not the default section or card skeleton.
- Use cards generously when they contain a coherent feature, person, plan, proof point, action, or media story. Give the page one base card language and at most one emphasized variant. Keep their radius, spacing logic, media treatment, and interaction feedback related while varying size and internal composition to fit the content. Never box ordinary prose, repeat an empty three-column template, or style every card as an unrelated experiment.
- Carry the brand accent into meaningful actions, focus and selected states, and a recurring card, media, or section treatment. Do not reduce the brand color to tiny labels or icons, and do not spread unrelated accent colors across every card.
- Prefer relevant photography, product imagery, and interface captures. Use SVG only for a simple functional icon, logo, or truthful data diagram whose meaning is immediately clear. Never select an SVG, abstract diagram, or fake interface merely to fill empty space.
- Keep the typography coherent across a section. Do not switch families repeatedly inside one line, sentence, card, or navigation item.

Hero text-layout cases:
1. Place a short, clear headline in the center. Add one smaller supporting sentence beneath it, followed by one or two CTA buttons.
2. Place the headline at the bottom left or bottom right. Add a short supporting line or description and the CTA buttons below it. Use the opposite bottom side for a small amount of additional information, either as clean text or in fitting cards.
3. Create an ultra-minimal centered hero. It may show only the brand name, one extremely short descriptive line, and one button. Let the visual design carry most of the impact.
4. Place one clear headline near the top center. Put the supporting description elsewhere in the composition, for example at the bottom left, and place the CTA where it best supports that hierarchy.
5. Use the familiar split: headline, supporting text, and CTA buttons on the left; a relevant image or visual on the right. This is common, so use it only when it genuinely fits.
6. Mirror the familiar split: image or visual on the left; headline, supporting text, and CTA buttons on the right.
7. Place the headline at the top left. Divide the supporting description, useful information, and CTA between the bottom left and bottom right with a clear reading order.

A Hero may lightly mix these text placements when the hierarchy remains clear. It still needs an immediately understandable headline, enough context to understand the offer, and a clear CTA. Do not make the composition complicated merely to appear different.

Hero image, graphic, and product-visual cases:
1. Use a full-screen background image. It may be minimal, visually intense, or otherwise appropriate. Brand color is especially important; when the site has no strong brand color, choose a natural color treatment that fits the intended mood.
2. Place one clean image on the left or right, according to the chosen text layout.
3. Place an image in the lower part of the Hero. It may occupy about half of the screen or extend farther, but it should already be visible in the initial Hero view.
4. Use a meaningful product image, editorial illustration, interface capture, or truthful data visual in the lower part of the Hero in the same way as the lower image case.
5. When the text is centered, arrange fitting images or other visual assets around the central message.
6. Place the text near the top center and show a wide dashboard, product preview, interface, or other relevant product visual beneath it. The preview may be broad without having to span the entire viewport.
7. Use a creative image or designed visual as the Hero background.

Navigation foundations:
- Treat Navigation as part of the Hero composition even though its layout is decided separately.
- Use either an icon mark or a full logo. Place it on the left or in the center. The logo always returns to the homepage or main landing page.
- Navigation destinations may appear as text links or button-like controls and must lead to the real page or section.
- Sign in, log in, sign up, and the main global CTA normally belong at the top right when they exist.
- A language selector may be included when the product needs one.
- With a centered logo, either place the main destinations on the left or distribute a small number around the logo. Keep enough space for account and CTA actions at the far right.

Navigation layout cases:
1. Use a normal, clean navigation bar with clickable page or section destinations and the logo linking home.
2. For a deeper site with destinations such as Enterprise, Solutions, or Pricing, let relevant items show a down arrow and open a larger card on hover or deliberate activation. The card may use one of these exact arrangements:
   a. Place a list of destinations with icons and subheadings on the left and a fitting image, designed visual, or graphic on the right. Swap the sides when the composition benefits. When there is more information, both sides may contain destination groups.
   b. Arrange destinations horizontally. Give each one an image, a subheading, and one very short explanatory sentence.
   c. Arrange the destinations as a clean bento-style card when that structure fits the amount and type of information.
3. Use a full-width navigation bar that runs from the left edge to the right edge. When it contains hover or disclosure content, let that panel also expand across the full width beneath it.
4. Use a long, modern floating pill or contained bar. Its corner radius may vary with the brand; it does not always need to be fully pill-shaped.
5. Begin with only the Hero content visible behind the navigation. As the user scrolls, smoothly introduce the navigation background or surface.
6. Use only the logo at the top left and a small amount of information or a menu control at the top right. Opening the control reveals a small, clean card with the relevant destinations or information.

All navigation dropdowns, cards, links, language controls, and buttons must actually work. Record the chosen layout and its disclosure or scroll behavior in navigationDesign, and record the real destinations in navigation. On smaller screens, preserve every necessary destination and action in a deliberate compact arrangement rather than squeezing the desktop layout. Use motion that matches the selected visual style and makes opening, closing, scrolling, and hierarchy feel smooth.

About section scope:
- An About section may describe the company, the people who work there, or both.
- Include it only when the page needs it. These are available layout cases, not sections that every page must use.

About layout cases:
1. Use a clean, very short, non-generic heading at the top. Arrange portraits of the people in an orderly grid, such as 2 by 5 or 4 by 3. Place an information card at the bottom inside each image with the person's name, role, and optionally one short description. The card may be inset from the image edges or extend cleanly across the full image width. Its corner radius may be rounded, square, or otherwise derived from the design.
2. Place a "Who we are" heading at the top left. It may be large or small according to the style. Optionally place one sentence at the top right. Show one clean team image beneath it with a caption such as "The team," then optionally add one or two more images with their own descriptions below.
3. Place a large heading at the top, aligned left, centered, or elsewhere according to the design. Build an open asymmetric image-and-text grid beneath it: for example, one large meaningful team image on the left with text below or near it, then a second image on the right shifted farther down with its description beside or beneath it. Scale the grid cells freely. A cell may contain an image, text, a clean brand asset, or a logo.
4. For a smaller team, place the heading first, then the names above the corresponding images in a clean arrangement. For a larger team, the people may move from left to right through a smooth GSAP scroll treatment.
5. Place an image of the team, workplace, or building on the left or right and put the company description on the opposite side.
6. Place one image or a group of images in the center, with additional images arranged on the left and right.
7. Create a more experimental checkerboard composition. Place portraits inside alternating square cells, reveal name cards on hover, leave selected cells empty, and use the opposite side for a short paragraph of company or team text.

Text-led About cases:
1. Use a heading with a block of company or team text. The text may reveal or fade in as the user scrolls, including with GSAP when that motion fits. Use clean typography; the type may be large or smaller according to the style. Place a small number of images beneath it.
2. Use only a heading and a larger amount of text, displayed creatively. The copy may use normal paragraphs or another fitting editorial arrangement.

About cards remain an open design surface: use any fitting card composition for people, facts, images, or company information rather than forcing one fixed card template. These cases may be refined later with fitting OriginKit components, but OriginKit must not replace the selected layout idea.

Feature section scope:
- Treat Features as one of the most open section types. These layouts may also fit a How It Works, Showcase, product explanation, or another later section when the content has the same structural needs.
- Use only the number of features the page actually needs. A layout may contain two, three, four, or five items; avoid placing so many in one row that each item loses clarity.

Feature heading cases:
1. Align the heading in the center, left, or even right according to the design and the page's established alignment logic.
2. Center the heading with one short centered description beneath it.
3. Place the heading on the left and the description on the right.
4. Reverse that relationship: description on the left and heading on the right.
5. Place the heading and description together on the left in a clean stack.
6. Use only the heading when no description is necessary.

Feature grid and card cases:
1. Use one horizontal row of three cards. Place a meaningful image, animation, interface fragment, or truthful data visual in the upper part of each card and its feature description beneath it.
2. Use three larger rows stacked from top to bottom when each feature needs more content. Place text and description on one side and a visualization on the other. Alternate the sides when appropriate. The visualizations may become progressively wider from one row to the next, creating a stair-step composition. This may also use two, four, or five rows when the content requires it.
3. Use a bento or another grid arrangement. Bento geometry may vary widely: four cards above and three below; one long and one short card above with the proportions reversed below; two-by-two or repeated pairs; or another arrangement that fits the content.
4. Inside a grid or bento card, include a feature heading and, when needed, one explanatory sentence. The sentence may highlight important keywords. Add a fitting visualization: an image, a creative product visual, a SaaS or dashboard mockup, or another relevant designed representation.
5. Feature cards may use colored surfaces, images, or background gradients. Use brand colors deliberately. A later gradient generator may provide fitting card backgrounds, but the gradient must serve the selected feature design.
6. A feature visualization may be a native interactive component or truthful data diagram when that communicates the feature better than an image. It must not be an ornamental SVG or generic filler.

Timed and changing Feature case:
- Present roughly two to five features with a timed progress line. One feature begins active while its line advances; when the interval completes, activate the next feature and replace or transform the visualization.
- The text labels may sit together in one horizontal line and loop through their active states, or each feature may have its own individually animated presentation.
- Place the visualization wherever the chosen composition needs it: left, right, above, or below. GSAP may drive the transition when appropriate.

Large and spatial Feature cases:
1. Use a background image with large feature cards. Let the cards move from left to right through GSAP, horizontal scroll, or direct dragging when that interaction fits. Each large card contains a heading and the extra explanatory text it needs.
2. Give roughly two thirds of the screen to a group of images or visualizations on the left and use the right side to explain them continuously. Mirror the layout when the design works better in the opposite direction.
3. Create a more immersive feature section. Place the text in the center, left, or right according to the composition. As the user scrolls, move images, assets, or visualizations through the scene: they may rise from bottom to top, new elements may enter or fall into the viewport, or the elements may move in a controlled swirl. Use GSAP when appropriate. A later OriginKit component may help implement the effect, but it must preserve this selected layout and movement idea.

Feature cards and visualizations remain an open design surface. Their font scale, spacing, radius, surface, image treatment, brand color, hover behavior, and motion must follow the approved style rather than one universal card design.

How It Works section scope:
- How It Works overlaps strongly with Feature layouts. Reuse the relevant Feature grid, card, visualization, immersive, or motion cases when they fit the process.
- A clear step sequence is the important additional element. Labels such as 1, 2, 3 or Day 1, Day 2 are appropriate here because they express a real order.
- Use the established heading and description arrangements rather than defining a separate heading system for this section.

How It Works layout cases:
1. Draw one horizontal line with numbered steps such as 1, 2, and 3. Place a card beneath each step with its description and, when fitting, an image, visualization, or animation.
2. Arrange the steps as cards that move from left to right through GSAP scrolling or direct dragging. Place clean previous and next controls beneath the sequence using left and right arrow buttons. Each card may combine one description with one visualization. Keep the card design fully open to the approved visual style.
3. Place a vertical list of steps on the left, running from top to bottom. The labels may use stages such as Day 1 and Day 2. Show the information and visualization for the active step on the right. The sequence may loop through the steps so the user can follow the process visually. Separate steps with spacing or compact progress markers, never a continuous top-to-bottom rule attached to the cards.
4. Reuse any compatible Feature layout when it explains the process more clearly than a dedicated step layout.
5. Draw a winding or snake-like line through the center of the section. Alternate the numbered steps between the left and right sides of the line, giving each step a visualization, additional text, or both.

The sequence, progress line, active state, dragging, arrow controls, looping, and scroll motion must remain understandable and functional. Their visual treatment follows the brand and may use the same open card language as Features.

Trusted-company and Social Proof element:
- Treat this as a small supporting element rather than a full section in most pages. Place it inside the Hero or between larger sections wherever it fits the composition.
- Optionally place one short, fitting trust line above the logos. Use only a statement supported by the available evidence.
- Use a simple continuously looping carousel of verified company logos moving from right to left.
- The logos do not need to move. A static row of roughly five logos is equally valid.
- When there are more logos, arrange them in a multi-row grid or logo-wall composition.
- Present logos in color or in a restrained gray treatment according to the brand and surrounding design.
- Use only real supplied or verified logos. Preserve their proportions and keep the carousel readable, smooth, and safe under reduced motion.

Stats and numbers section:
- Use only real, supported numbers. Do not invent metrics to fill the layout.
1. Place a strong, fitting quote at the top left. Arrange a small set of cards beneath it with large numbers and clear descriptions.
2. Use a clean background image. Place the heading and a paragraph on the left and a group of clean numbers on the right. The right side may contain only two very large numbers or a longer list of smaller number-and-description items.
3. Use a bento arrangement for the quote, numbers, descriptions, and any supporting visual. This may overlap with the same open grid and card language used for Features or How It Works.

FAQ section:
1. Use a standard clean heading with optional supporting text beneath it, followed by a list of questions that open and close.
2. Place "FAQ" at the top with a "Last updated" date beneath it. When there are many questions, place a small table of contents on the left and the questions on the right, grouped into clear categories.
3. Place a large "FAQ," "Questions," or another fitting heading on the left and the question list on the right.
4. Present the questions as designed cards that expand, or as a simple accordion list. Choose between them according to the page design rather than using one universal FAQ treatment.

FAQ questions must actually expand and collapse, remain keyboard accessible, expose their state, and preserve a clear reading order on compact screens.

CTA section scope:
- Use this section for a waitlist, account creation, sign-up, newsletter, or another clear next action.
- Lead with a compelling invitation rather than a generic section heading. Add more explanatory text only when the action needs it.

CTA layout cases:
1. Use one large image with the compelling CTA text placed over it. Add an email input and CTA button when the action collects email, or use the fitting sign-up buttons for the requested action. Design the complete composition to make the action inviting and obvious.
2. Place an image or product mockup on the left and the invitation or sign-up action on the right. Mirror it only when the surrounding layout needs the opposite direction.
3. Use a clean headline with one clean button and place one large image beneath them.
4. Place the action word itself, such as "Sign up," directly inside the headline as a button or button-like interactive element.
5. Place the CTA text at the top left, a group of images in tiles or a bento arrangement on the right, and the CTA buttons at the bottom left.
6. Use one large headline followed by a distinctive, visually prominent button.
7. Place the headline and CTA first, then arrange images beneath them.

CTA fields and buttons must perform the real requested action, show clear focus and submission states, and avoid collecting information the product does not need.

Pricing section scope:
- Use only real plans, prices, billing periods, benefits, limits, and disclaimers from the available evidence.
- The heading may simply say "Pricing" or "Plans," or use one short fitting sentence. Add one supporting sentence only when needed.

Pricing billing controls:
- When both billing periods exist, let the user switch between monthly and annual pricing. The control may be a compact toggle, two larger buttons, or two clear side-by-side text choices.

Pricing layout cases:
1. Use plan cards. Each card contains the plan name, such as Free, Pro, Max, or Premium; the real recurring price or billing terms; the included benefits; and a clean action button. When a qualification or limitation needs an asterisk, place the corresponding short disclaimer beneath the cards.
2. Use a comparison table. Place benefits in the left column and plans across the top, then show clearly which benefits are included or unavailable for each plan.
3. Use a bento composition. For example, Free may use its own card while a larger neighboring card contains separate Pro and Max choices. Other groupings are valid when they reflect the real plan structure.
4. Design the cards with a clean surface, a fitting background image, or a restrained shader effect. Later tools may help create the background treatment, but it must not obscure prices, benefits, or actions.

Billing controls, plan actions, checks, unavailable states, and disclaimers must be functional, legible, and unambiguous on every viewport.

Contact section:
- Use a contact form on the right or centered in the section. Place the supporting contact information on the left or above the form. A fitting background image may support the composition.
- Include only the fields the contact flow needs, such as email, name, message, or another required detail, followed by a clear submit action and any necessary short supporting information.
- The style may vary widely. The text on the left may be a normal explanation, only one or two short words, or a small block positioned at the far bottom left.
- Keep the form simple and make every field, validation state, and submission result work clearly.

Footer layout cases:
1. Use a fitting background image behind the footer when the design benefits from it.
2. Use the same structure without a background image for a cleaner footer.
3. Group destinations into columns with headings and sub-links that lead to the real pages. Place copyright information and social links along the bottom.
4. Make a large logo the main visual element, or place the logo at the very bottom so it is intentionally cropped by the lower edge.
5. Place the brand name near the top of the footer and arrange all link groups beneath it.
6. Place each grouped set of links inside its own card when that card structure fits the design.
7. Add one short descriptive text block when the footer needs context about the brand or product.

Footer columns, cards, logo treatment, background image, typography, spacing, and alignment remain open to the approved style. Every destination and social link must be real, and compact layouts must retain the full information hierarchy.`
