Resolve the page blueprint's asset and component needs into a compact manifest. Inspect the project first and reuse suitable existing files and dependencies. Keep IDs identical to the page blueprint and include every assetNeeds and componentNeeds entry exactly once. This is an acquisition phase, not a wish list: when the session exposes the necessary tools, create or download the actual file inside the project before marking it ready. Mark a need as ready only when its source is real, its local project destination exists, and its provenance is recorded; otherwise leave it needed with actionable requirements.

For every manifest record, classify its semantic role and copy sectionIds exactly from the page sections whose assetNeeds or componentNeeds contains that ID. A footer photo credit does not consume the photograph: do not add footer unless its needs explicitly list the asset ID. Shared brand fonts may name their actual consuming sections. Give visual records an exact width:height ratio plus a concrete composition brief. Reuse fitting supplied or existing project assets first. For missing original visuals, prefer image generation when available; if unavailable or unsuccessful, use licensed online image search. For explicitly real subjects, use matching verified imagery rather than generated substitutes. Concept studies, illustrative rosters, cover artwork, and new product imagery are valid original visual needs; acquire each required image rather than declaring nonexistent client or artist materials mandatory. The supplied references and the page's referenceDirectionId are the composition contract: preserve their media role, crop logic, focal placement, visual density, and relationship to surrounding copy while adapting the subject and identity to this project.

When source.kind is "user", source.reference must be the stable user-reference-# ID from the supplied-reference catalog, never an upload path or basename. Copy any supplied asset used by the page into the workspace and record its destination, including assets marked existing, so the finished page does not depend on an upload path. Generated and downloaded raster visuals must be real PNG, JPEG, WebP, or GIF files whose pixel dimensions match aspectRatio; do not rename another format or accept a low-resolution thumbnail. Generated and external visuals need at least 960 pixels on their long edge, 360 on their short edge, and 0.7 megapixels. All raster visuals need at least 160,000 pixels and a 180-pixel short edge; keep images within 16 megapixels and 32 MB per file.

For generation, use an available image tool with the selected reference composition and approved brand as direction. Generate one finished asset per file, not a screenshot collage or a whole page. State the exact subject, art direction, camera or rendering language, aspect ratio, crop, focal placement, palette relationship, background, exclusions, and text-safe area before calling the tool. Inspect the resulting file at its intended crop. If it is visibly generic, malformed, off-reference, poorly composed, or wrong for the frame, make at most one bounded regeneration with the observed defect corrected; never accept a weak first result merely because a file exists. Save the accepted result to the local destination. Do not generate fake UI, functional icons, data diagrams, logos made from arbitrary marks, or generic abstract filler. For search, use an available web or image-search tool, verify the source page and reuse terms, download the actual image to the local destination, and record the source-page URL plus license. Never claim that a search or generation happened when the session cannot perform it.

Prefer meaningful photography, product imagery, and real interface captures over decorative SVGs. Every image-led selected layout case must receive the meaningful image or capture it describes; do not quietly replace it with a generic vector, gradient, empty card, or fake product UI. Never generate a raster screenshot for a simple form, calendar, dashboard, chart, or interface that Build can implement faithfully with native components. Use the project's established icon set for functional icons; do not generate or hand-draw arbitrary SVG icons. SVG is allowed only for an explicit functional icon, logo, or truthful data diagram. It is never acceptable for photography, a product image, editorial art, an interface capture, or a general visual placeholder, even when renamed with another extension. Do not satisfy an open visual need with an abstract diagram, fake dashboard, sonar graphic, line-grid ornament, or generic geometric filler. If generation and licensed search are both unavailable, leave a precise image need unresolved instead of inventing an unclear substitute.

Acquire every approved brand typeface as actual local font files with its license, including when Page omitted a font asset ID. Use only available weights. Verify the official Google Fonts repository or the family's official source; never mark Arial or a system fallback as the acquired custom family. Record each font file, including real italic and weight variants, with its actual consuming sections. A family folder is also accepted and expanded into its concrete font files. Preserve valid raster provenance metadata; an embedded metadata icon does not turn a PNG photograph into an SVG.

OriginKit is optional. Only when an OriginKit MCP server is available and a component need would materially benefit, search once with the specific need and fetch only a fitting result. A missing server, authentication problem, rate limit, or unsuitable result is a normal fallback: leave the component needed for local implementation and continue. For a component that Build will implement, use status needed and omit source and destination entirely. Do not invent a project source path for an unbuilt component. Native HTML/CSS requires no download or component search. Never invent a component ID or claim a fetch succeeded. Record any fetched component with source kind "origin-kit".

Use kind data and role data for any required attribution or other structured JSON file, never component or image. Data files must be valid JSON within 1 MB and retain their real provenance. Do not create a separate credit asset unless the page needs one; each image's source fields already record attribution.
For external sources, source.reference must contain only an HTTP(S) source-page URL, without author names or surrounding prose. Put attribution names and reuse terms in source.license or requirements. For generated sources, record the actual generation tool and output identifier; do not invent a public URL for a local generation.

Do not implement the page, install dependencies, or make new brand and copy decisions in this phase. Use available image-generation or image-search tools directly; do not invoke external design skills.
