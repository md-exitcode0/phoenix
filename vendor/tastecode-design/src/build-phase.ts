Implement the supplied artifacts in the current workspace. First inspect the real project entry points, architecture, scripts, styles, dependencies, and existing user changes. Reuse them. Do not scaffold a second app or replace the project's framework, package manager, design system, or build pipeline.

Treat brief facts and constraints as requirements, brand.json as the design system, page.json as the content and composition plan, and assets.json as the provenance ledger. Attached user mockups and the selected catalog's desktop/mobile images are the visual source for page.json's referenceDirectionId choices. Inspect them before editing. Reproduce each section's measured composition map before changing identity content. Compare desktop and mobile captures side by side with the corresponding reference at the same content width; fix the largest geometry, typography and media discrepancies first. Record any remaining deviation and its concrete content, accessibility or responsive reason. “Simpler” or “cleaner” is not a reason to replace the composition. Preserve unrelated work. Use small, coherent edits and accessible native elements. Run the project's relevant typecheck, tests, lint, and build; repair failures caused by this implementation.

Do not improvise around an unresolved meaningful visual asset. Build may implement a simple interface or truthful data view as native components when page.json records it as a component need. It may not replace photography, product imagery, editorial art, or an interface capture with an SVG, CSS gradient, fake dashboard, generic geometry, or locally invented placeholder. If a required meaningful visual remains needed, return the failed shape and name the asset instead of degrading the design.

Each page section records a referenceDirectionId, layoutFamily, one or more selected layoutCases, and a content-specific layout. The reference is the primary hard composition requirement; layout cases classify and support it. Preserve its recognizable macro geometry, hierarchy, relative proportions, alignment, overlap, density, negative-space rhythm, media count and placement, and movement at expanded size, then follow the recorded medium and compact transformations. Adapt project identity, copy, palette, typography, icons, image subject, and small component details. Do not invent a second motif or replace the reference with a generic centered heading, uniform card grid, familiar split Hero, or vertically stacked mobile page unless that is the reference. Do not render IDs as visible copy.

Implement each section's recorded motion decision as deliberately as its layout. Use the project's existing motion dependencies when present, native CSS and IntersectionObserver for simple cases, and GSAP-style timelines only when the recorded scroll, drag, pin, or sequence cannot be expressed cleanly without them. Keep interface feedback under 300ms unless the artifact gives a justified exception, animate transform and opacity instead of layout properties, never use transition: all, and never enter from scale(0). Gate hover motion behind hover-capable fine pointers and implement the recorded prefers-reduced-motion behavior. Do not apply the same fade-up to every section or animate decorative elements without a purpose.

Enforce this visual quality floor:
- Derive heading scale and placement from the selected reference at each viewport. Match its line count, text block width and relative size. Do not flatten an intentionally large or multi-line reference headline into generic small type.
- Preserve reference labels, type contrast and case, using the approved typefaces. Load real font assets at supported weights and verify document.fonts.ready, a matching FontFace with status loaded, and document.fonts.check; a declared family falling back to Arial is a failed typography check.
- Keep the Hero to one headline, at most one concise supporting block, and its actions. Do not add a second description, implementation note, prototype disclaimer, or status message.
- Do not show internal notes such as awaiting approval, still needed, not connected, before launch, or to be supplied. Representative interface records, weather, dates, inventory, and operational values may be created for a finished one-shot experience. Preserve the visible identification required by the content-scope rules for concept work and illustrative catalogs. Record every invented value in a Build summary beginning "Verify before publishing:" so TasteCode can show it after Preview.
- Reproduce reference spacing, rules, borders, radii and surfaces. Do not add decorative card-edge rails, grids or square panels absent from the reference, and do not remove ones visibly present.
- Use the reference's grouping: open columns remain open, editorial layouts remain editorial, and cards remain cards. Unify padding, radius, control states and typography where cards actually occur. Do not add boxes to ordinary prose or flatten distinct compositions into equal-column templates.
- Apply the approved brand accent to the primary action, focus and selected states, and a recurring card, media, or section treatment. The finished page must not become generic gray with the accent confined to tiny labels, icons, or underlines, and it must not become a rainbow of unrelated card colors.
- Use the exact supplied, generated, or properly sourced files recorded in assets.json. Do not create an abstract SVG, fake dashboard, map, sonar, schematic, decorative line graphic, or substitute visual just to occupy space. SVG is limited to an explicit functional icon, logo, or truthful data diagram; it is never a substitute for photography, product imagery, editorial art, or an interface capture.
- Never stretch images. Match the reference frame and focal placement using an appropriate source crop or object-fit: cover with deliberate object-position; preserve important subject content. Request or generate a better aspect ratio when a crop cannot work. Do not rasterize a simple dashboard, form, calendar or interface that can be rendered natively.
- Preserve intentional large media, asymmetry, alignment and negative space from the reference. Remove accidental gaps, unrelated decorative additions and redundant actions. Do not default introductions to stacked text or force all imagery into the same ratio.
- Keep one coherent light or dark palette through adjacent sections. A deliberate tonal shift may use related roles from the same palette, but never alternate unrelated light and dark themes for novelty. Use one primary type family through the page; a second family is a rare role-specific contrast, not a recurring serif/sans toggle.
- When a supplied gradient recipe materially improves a card, section, or page atmosphere, use at most one matching purpose per view. Keep readable content on the recipe's opaque contentSurface; do not place body copy or controls directly over a decorative field. A gradient is optional and never a substitute for imagery, hierarchy, or content.
- Use the project's established icon set or an installed professional icon dependency. Do not hand-draw arbitrary SVG icons. Do not leave a section as a flat color field with only a heading and sentence when meaningful cards, media, proof, or interaction are available.
- Style every visible control to the brand, including selects, dropdown menus, date entry, calendars, disclosure panels, and form states. Preserve semantic HTML, keyboard access, focus, labels, and reduced motion, but never leave a browser-default control as the finished visual treatment.
- Give every visible interactive target a clickable area of at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels at every reviewed viewport. Verify the rendered hit area, not only the text line height or visible icon size.
- Check every reviewed viewport for text collision, clipping, horizontal overflow, unreadable narrow columns, and footer overlap. Content must have enough space to read; novelty never excuses broken geometry.
- Ensure the app can render, not merely bundle. When writing JSX, use the project's configured automatic JSX transform; if none exists, import React in every JSX module that needs it. A successful production build with a blank runtime is a failed Build.

Use the existing project implementation and motion tools without invoking external design skills. Do not start a long-running preview server in this phase; TasteCode owns Preview next.

${DESIGN_CONTENT_GUIDANCE}

${DESIGN_MOTION_GUIDANCE}

Use this tested native reveal implementation for simple scroll entrances; copy or inline it in the existing script and call installReferenceReveals after mounting. Mark selected leaf groups data-reveal="rise|slide|media". Keep CSS visible by default. In React return its cleanup from the effect. An existing motion library may implement the same lifecycle guarantees. The hero is separate: use a transform-only entrance if it has already painted; never hide it late while waiting for fonts or assets.
